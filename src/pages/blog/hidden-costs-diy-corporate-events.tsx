          The Hidden Costs of DIY Corporate Events
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          You're staring at the budget for your upcoming leadership summit, and the temptation is real: "How hard can it be to plan this ourselves?"
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          I understand that impulse. As someone who has guided hundreds of executives through high-stakes events, I've seen brilliant leaders make this exact calculation. The math seems simple—cut the planner, save the fee. But here's what I've learned after decades in this industry: DIY corporate events don't just risk failure—they guarantee hidden costs that far exceed any savings.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Let me share what really happens when you go it alone, and why the smartest leaders choose a different path.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
          The Financial Reality Behind "Cost Savings"
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          When "Savings" Become Expenses
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The hidden costs start immediately. That rush order for forgotten signage? The overtime hours for your marketing team who's never negotiated with caterers? The penalty fees when you need to change venues last-minute because you didn't know to ask about exclusive dates?
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          At E&amp;P Events, I've built relationships with vendors across Atlanta and beyond over decades. These partnerships mean better rates, flexible terms, and the kind of trust that saves you money when things need to change—because they always do.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Your Team's True Cost
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          When you pull your marketing director into event coordination, you're not just adding to their workload—you're subtracting from their core contributions. That product launch strategy? The Q4 campaign? These get delayed or diluted because your high-performers are sourcing linens instead of driving revenue.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The opportunity cost is real, and it compounds.
        </p>

          Strategic Missteps That Undermine Success
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Misaligned Objectives, Missed Opportunities
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Every corporate event should serve your larger business goals. Without strategic guidance, you might create a beautiful gathering that fails to move the needle. I help leaders define clear objectives upfront—whether that's strengthening stakeholder relationships, launching a new initiative, or celebrating cultural milestones in ways that resonate authentically.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          The Vendor Maze
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          After twenty years of navigating vendor relationships, I know which partners deliver on promises and which ones leave you scrambling. More importantly, I know how to structure contracts that protect you and build in contingencies that matter.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          When you're negotiating alone, you're operating without this intelligence—and vendors know it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
          Reputational Risks You Can't Afford

          Your Brand on Display
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Every corporate event is a brand showcase, whether you intend it or not. Inconsistent messaging, cultural missteps, or logistical failures reflect directly on your organization's competence and values.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I bring cultural intelligence to every event, ensuring your gathering honors diverse perspectives and creates inclusive experiences that strengthen rather than strain relationships.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Crisis-Proof Execution
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Technology fails. VIPs arrive unexpectedly. Weather changes plans. The difference between professionals and DIY planners isn't that we prevent every problem—it's that we anticipate them and respond with calm competence.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Your guests should never see you sweat. With proper planning, they won’t have to.
