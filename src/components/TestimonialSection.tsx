E&P were so amazing at listening to my ideas, contributing to them to make them even better, then implementing them in the most perfect way. They were so easy to work with along the way, and best of all the attention to detail was fantastic. They thought of things I never would have, always keeping in mind our vision for our day. The day couldn't have been more beautiful, and I couldn't have imagined working with better planners.",

    text: "Peter Samuel really provides world-class service. I worked extensively with Peter on a number of global United Nations programs, working with corporate executives and high-ranking government officials and dignitaries from over 20-30 countries around the world represented at each event. Peter provided exceptional strategic direction and corporate planning, exquisite event management, and impeccable attention to detail. He pulled off events seamlessly and flawlessly and delegates were always impressed. Peter's attention to customer service is exceptional and he is so responsive and unflappable in even the most complex of situations. More than a safe pair of hands that I could rely on with complete confidence; he is also a true maestro that could orchestrate any event we threw at him with perfection. An absolute joy to work with him!",

You looked at our budget and helped to find ways to not only stay within budget but to still go above and beyond with how we could successfully show appreciation to our volunteers! You were timely and thoughtful with how you set everything up and all of the departments felt valued because of how you served us. Thank you for stepping in, especially at the last minute, to help us plan through everything. Our leadership team felt at ease with your expertise and careful attention to detail! We will definitely reach out again for the next event!",

I, too, am in the planning business but with my son getting married, I knew I had to find professionals to fill the day-of gap. You should know that when a colleague is impressed, you will more than likely be too. I recommend E&P Events, in fact, I'm quite certain their full service planning would also be top notch.",

    text: "I literally cannot say enough nice things about Essie and Peter. Everything that could have gone wrong during my reception did (the cater didn't show up....like really...?) but they took every issue and knocked it out of the park. By the time I noticed that the caterers weren't there, Peter had already talked to them and food was on the way. They pay attention to small details like packing us food to take to the hotel after, and making sure my grandparents and parents got food. All the issues that went on were taken care of without anyone even noticing. They are both so much fun to just talk to as well! It felt like we were talking to our friends in all of our meetings. I still can't believe I was second guessing hiring a day of coordinator, other than my now husband, E&P Events is the best decision I made that day! THANK YOU!!!!!!!",

[E&P Events] were very attentive and remembered little details like making sure I was replenished with snacks! I would most definitely want to work with him again in the future!",
